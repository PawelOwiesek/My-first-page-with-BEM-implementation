## My-first-page-with-BEM-implementation.
#### This is my first website, **I'm very proud of it** because it may not be perfect, but it's my first independent work.<br> Creating it was the first major challenge, it gave me incredible fun, excitement when everything started working as I wanted, and a few endorphin burstsðŸ˜ƒ.
### Please visit my page at: https://pawelowiesek.github.io/My-first-page-with-BEM-implementation/ *note that the website is in Polish*.

### The following was used to build the site:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
